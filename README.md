# WhenInDoubtCYourWayOut
CSCE 121 Project

Howdy,

The game is sort of working...when I have time inbetween classes I will continue to get the code working better. I will make sure and comment as soon as I have time too, you can feel free to ask me to clarify anything in the meantime.

Main objective now is to start making it look decent, the game GUI I made was just some stuff thrown on a window to make it work. The score window also isnt coming up right now...I will have to play with that some more to get it working.

All you have to do when you contribute to the project is click upload and make a new branch so that the changes can be reviewed.

Thanks!
