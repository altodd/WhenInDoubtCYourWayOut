Howdy,

The main game is working now for the most part, I am dealing with the beginner window now and when it finally works properly,
I will update all the other windows.

The current problem with the beginner window is there is an error opening the score window at the end of the game. We need to make sure the game window also closes, as right now the user can indefinetly make choices when the score window fails, which isn't good.

The visual interface needs to be highly improved, and the report done. Code will also need to have good comments since we have to turn in the hard copy.

Thanks!
