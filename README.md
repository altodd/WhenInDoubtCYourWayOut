# WhenInDoubtCYourWayOut
CSCE 121 Project

Howdy,

So far the game logic is done...it currently is just a terminal game which we can modify the input after the graphics are done. I have made it a three input game which tracks the percentage that the computer wins.

You can download the files and see how it works, I just added comments.

All you have to do when you contribute to the project is click upload and make a new branch so that the changes can be reviewed.

Thanks!
